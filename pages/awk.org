#+TITLE: awk

** The basic format of an awk command is:

~awk '/search_pattern/ { action_to_take_on_matches; another_action; }' file_to_parse~
** You can omit either the search portion or the action portion from any awk command. By default, the action taken if the “action” portion is not given is “print”. This simply prints all lines that match.

If the search portion is not given, awk performs the action listed on each line.
