#+TITLE: vars

** Interning
The Namespace system maintains global maps of symbols to Var objects (see Namespaces). If a def expression does not find an interned entry in the current namespace for the symbol being def-ed, it creates one, otherwise it uses the existing Var. This find-or-create process is called interning. This means that, unless they have been unmap-ed, Var objects are stable references and need not be looked up every time. It also means that namespaces constitute a global environment in which, as described in Evaluation, the compiler attempts to resolve all free symbols as Vars.

The var special form or the #' reader macro (see Reader) can be used to get an interned Var object instead of its current value.
